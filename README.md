### Free version for `nativescript-platform-css` (renamed to `nativescript-platform-css-free`)

Since all of these basic plugins have become paid now, I will try and maintain them for free for as long as I can.


To use this, simply install with NPM using:

`npm install nativescript-platform-css-free`


All credit goes to: <a href="https://github.com/NathanaelA">NathanaelA</a> for writing this. I am only attempting to maintain it without charging anything.
