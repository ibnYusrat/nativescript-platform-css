# NativeScript Platform SS (Free)

I created  a fork of the original `nativescript-platform-css` because the original plugin requires a subscription and is not maintained any more. I will try to keep this from breaking specially for beginners wh want to learn NativeScript. 

To install it, simply run: 

`npm install nativescript-platform-css-free`

And use it like you would normally.

Please follow the original ReadMe for deatils on how to use it.
